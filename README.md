# caloriecalculator2.0

# Overview


This project is a calorie calculator, which collects a list of user inputted food items as well as servings, and calculates the total caloric value of the combined calories. My purpose of creating this software was that I wanted to create something very applicable to most people's everyday lives while simultaniously learning how to more effectively use databases to extract useful information. I think this particular program is especially useful because it efficiently breaks up a large database to quickly display important data to the user. I wanted to become better at using large databases, which I think is a skill that will dramatically aid my efforts to become a better software engineer.

# Development Environment


A couple different tools were used in the creation of this program. Visual Studio Code was used as a development enviornment, python was used as the programming language, and the pandas module was used to read the data from a xls file into the code.
